                 <p >        My name is Alayu Estifanos, and I’m a professional web developer and graphical 
        designer. I’ve just joined the software department in addis ababa University as a student.I’ll be getting 
        a good knowledge with some, informational and technological issues, If you see a new face around, well, 
        that’s me:) I am currently in my second year of my Early Childhood Study’s Degree. I am 20 years old and 
        live in large family of 5 siblings. </p>
        <p>
        I have previously studied java and python and html my A-levels and throughout my years of 
        learning.I can honestly put forward that knowledge can always be captured no matter what the profession, 
        there is no such thing as too much knowledge. In addition, I am extremely grateful to have gained all my 
        experiences and skills and will always keep an eye out for new opportunities.In the beginning of my academic
        year I witnessed a major difference between the learning environment, this is mainly because I transitioned 
        through differnert programming languages where the environment was more controlled and students were less independent. 
    </p>
    <p>
        University to me in comparison to our preparatory school, felt more independent and relaxed, however although in 
        the beginning I was quite frightened by the change of environment and people, with the help of the staff 
        I managed to make new friends from all age groups. This enabled me to share my experience as well as gain
        an insight into other individuals experiences.

                I believ in the principle of Knowledge is the essence of smart thinking. No matter how much raw 
            intelligence I have, I am not going to succeed at solving complex problems without knowing a lot. 
        </p>
            That's why I spend the first 20 years of my lives in school.  It is also important to study over
            a period of days rather waiting until the last minute …show more content…So, self-testing needs to 
            involve deeper questions than the ones that are usually written on flash cards.From my universty 
            most of universty students tend to focus their study on upcoming assignments. That is no surprise, 
            because college is a busy time.The most successful students, though, also schedule time to study for
            classes even before the exam is coming up. The students who make a schedule and stick with it tend to
            get better grades than those who just work on whatever is coming up. Finally,the time of day that 
            students study also matters. College students are notorious night owls. Indeed, few students reported 
            studying in the morning, or even in the afternoon. Most students study in the evening and late at night. 
            <p>
            One of the interesting results of this research, though, is that the students who study late at night 
            tend to get worse grades than those who study in the evening. It is always nice when studies of real-world 
            behavior mesh with recommendations from basic research. In the case of studying, though, it seems particularly 
            important to ensure that basic research influences behavior. People invest several years and thousands of dollars 
            in a college education. That education has an enormous effect on their future productivity. Cognitive
            science can ensure that students maximize the value of that experience.

                <P>
            A great place to start your study strategy is to devise a routine. Research suggests that short study blocks with 
            frequent breaks are most effective. Combine this with mixing the subject areas throughout the day to give yourself
            more variety. Also, set yourself clear daily, weekly and monthly targets – this makes it easier to track your 
            progress in relation to the exam date.
        </P>  
            Second Learning maps
            <p>
             Map out what you need to learn. Get colourful and creative, use mind maps, Venn diagrams and topic trees to 
            clearly layout what you need to study. This will help you visualise the topics and find synergies between them.
        </p>      
            Third Spaces and places
        <p>
            Find a place that suits how you study. For most it’s somewhere quiet with little distraction, like a library or a 
            small café. Everyone’s different, so as long as it works for you - stick with it.
        </p>          
            Finaly you ,must select When and how caan you read more
        <p>   
            If you’re a full time student then you can devote all day to studying, though as mentioned above, you still need
            to plan a strategy – having so much time on your hands can be overwhelming and doing nothing but studying can 
            actually be a frustration. Alternatively, for those working and/or with families, you need to study as and when
            you can, so the temptation will be to study intensively, but you should follow some structure to your sessions 
            and factor in breaks and time to reflect.
